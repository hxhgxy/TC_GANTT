This is a WPF control to similate MS Project Gantt Chart.
The grid part is reffered to ReoGrid (https://github.com/unvell/ReoGrid), but I would like to make it very simple. So there would be lots of bugs.

Screen shot for Gantt Chart:

Worksheet has Changed event, so you can refer to codes below to update tasks information and update the Gantt Chart.

There are lots of functions to be added later on.
